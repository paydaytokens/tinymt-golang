# TinyMT-golang

[TinyMT](https://github.com/MersenneTwister-Lab/TinyMT) is an algorithm used to generate random numbers. This is a Golang port of the C/C++ version of 64bit TinyMT. Its nearly identical to the original, but adjusted to Go.

# Params
The hardcoded params are generated with the original TinyMT. [This git repo provides many params to choose from.](https://github.com/jj1bdx/tinymtdc-longbatch) Currently there is no golang version of TinyMTdc
